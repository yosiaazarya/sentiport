# sentiport

**Sentiport** is a program to create and send automated report from *Google Playstore* review data. Started from **Supertype** and developed to be used for **Algoritma**, can be accessed directly on [algoritma-sentiport](https://algorit.ma/sentiport/).

**Sentiport** could turn review data into several information in summaries and plots and use several libraries such as *Beautifoulsoup* and *google-play-scraper* for data scraping; *Pandas, Numpy, regex* for data wrangling; *nltk, Spacy, textblob* for NLP data processing; *Matplotlib* for visualization; *reportlab* for report (PDF) making. **Sentiport** is built in *Flask* and deployed in *Heroku*.

Current purpose of **Algo-Sentiport** is to help **Algoritma** gain new corporate leads and goals for project in near future. Has been coordinated and approved by stakeholders and principals.
